# MPE-Automatic-report-generation-for-Medical-Images


This project is my individual Master's research project, which took one year to complete.  
The full details can be found in **Project Report.pdf**.  

Below is the complete execution workflow:

1. **Fine-tuning LLaMA 3**  
   Run `train_llama_pretrained.py` to fine-tune the LLaMA 3 model.

2. **Baseline Report Generation (Pre-trained LLaMA 3)**  
   Run `llama3_base_radiology_report_generation_inference_comparison.py` to generate simulated medical reports using the original pre-trained LLaMA 3.

3. **Report Generation with Fine-tuned LLaMA 3**  
   Run `llama3_finetuned_indiana_radiology_report_generation_inference_comparison.py` to generate simulated medical reports using the fine-tuned LLaMA 3.  
   By comparing the reports generated by the original LLaMA 3 and the fine-tuned LLaMA 3, we can demonstrate that fine-tuning enables the model to effectively use domain-specific medical terminology.

4. **Training the Joint Vision-Language Model**  
   Run `vision_language_joint_finetuning.py` to train the joint model, which consists of:
   - Fine-tuned LLaMA 3 (language model)  
   - Projection model  
   - ConvNeXt V2 (vision model)

5. **Medical Report Generation and Evaluation**  
   Run `generate_finetuning_llama3_medical_reports_bleu.py` to test the trained joint model.  
   - Input: Medical images  
   - Output: Generated medical reports  
   - Evaluation: BLEU score
